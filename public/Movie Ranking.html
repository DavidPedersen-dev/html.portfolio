 <h1> David's Top 3 Movies</h1>
 <h2>A brief list of my favorites</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>The Northman</h3>
 <p>This film by Robert Eggers perfectly captures the brutality of a viking tale while also preserving magic of old norse ways.</p>
 <h3>Drive</h3>
 <p>Ryan Gosling creates a stoic, humble hero who can drive anyone anywhere. This film is a basket packed with meloncholy flavored intensity that contrasts well in the hills of Los Angeles.</p>
 <h3>The Florida Project</h3>
 <p>The closest you can get to Kissimmee, Florida without getting your nose wet. Willem Dafoe plays yet another brilliant supporting character.</p>
