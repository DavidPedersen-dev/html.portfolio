<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am David Pedersen! A millenial gamer sphynx loving surfer who very recently started his journey as a Web Developer.
  I started my professional career in the field of IT when I was 20 years old, specifically learning about data 
  transmission in the military. Fast forward to now, I'm ready to make a leap into something I find a bit more 
  interesting!
</p>

<p>From as far back as fifteen years old I can remember having a passion to be a part of projects and a team of people 
  who created things. Someone who I look up to in the digital arts field is a video game develper named Hideo Kojima. 
  I think part of my reason for wanting to be a Web Developer stems from a desire to create things in a digital space
  like Kojima does in his awesome game him and his team create. My younger brother also started his career as a Web 
  Developer, so I'd be lying if I said he didn't reignite my desire to learn within this realm again.


</p>

<p>Web Development is important to me because it allows me to actively use my brain to create tangible, beautiful designs
  that I can be proud of. I think it's a source of fresh purpose and creativity in my life and I'm excited to see what
  opportunities it will afford me in the future!
